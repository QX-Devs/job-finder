We often learn by shipping, so you won’t find an obsession with rigid processes here. As the Engineering team ramps up hiring, we’re committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); constantly surveying employees, participating in training, and learning from our DEI Committee.\n\nThough we care deeply and work diligently, there’s no extra credit for working long nights or spending weekends squashing bugs. When we’re off, we’re really off, enjoying our personal lives and recharging our batteries.\n\nAt the end of the day, we delight in how much our users adore our product. It’s incredibly fulfilling to read thank you tweets from teachers and know that, hey, we built something that makes a meaningful impact! And while we saw massive growth during the pandemic, we’ve still got a lot more growing to do. Joining our team now means you’ll get to help us take on new markets and innovate the next features that make the learning experience even better.\n\nYour Role:\n\nThis is a role for an engineer who enjoys solving deep technical problems, working with complex data pipelines, and integrating with AI/ML models — with a focus on delivering high-quality experiences for schools, teachers, and students.\n\nYour Responsibilities:\n\n\nDesign and build backend services and pipelines that power Arabic-enabled features such as AI activity generation, resource conversion, Reading Fluency (Arabic), and Read With Me (Arabic).\nCollaborate closely with product, design and cross-functional engineering teams to integrate and operationalize AI/ML models and ensure high-quality Arabic input/output and proper RTL handling.\nDevelop robust APIs, data models, and asynchronous job workflows that support Seesaw’s international expansion and bilingual classroom needs.\nSupport critical rostering or integration issues, partnering with Support to maintain reliability for schools without taking on routine tickets.\nContribute to architecture, technical roadmap planning, and engineering best practices to help establish a strong backend culture in the new Jordan team.\n\n\nYour Requirements:\n\n\n3+ years of backend engineering experience, ideally with Python, AWS\nStrong understanding of Computer Science fundamentals, whether gained through a CS degree or equivalent experience (bootcamps + non-traditional backgrounds welcome).\nDirect experience designing, developing, and maintaining backend services at scale — the best candidates can speak to data models, queueing systems, API boundaries, and production constraints.\nFamiliarity with modern web technologies and service architectures, including REST APIs, RPC frameworks, and asynchronous job pipelines.\nComfort working within complex distributed systems, especially when dealing with text-processing pipelines, encoding issues, or language-specific logic (e.g., RTL, bidi text).\nAbility to write clean, maintainable, self-documenting code and to design simple, elegant solutions for complex backend problems.\nExperience integrating with or consuming ML/AI models, whether through APIs, SDKs, or custom services (OCR, ASR, NLP, TTS are a plus).\n\n\nPreferred Experience:\n\n\nStrong backend intuition and a desire to build performant, robust, and thoughtful features inside a complex international platform.\nExperience with Python, Flask, DynamoDB, Postgres, Redis, message queues, or backend storage/caching layers.\nExperience working with AI/ML pipelines, especially around text processing, OCR, speech recognition, or TTS — particularly useful for Arabic feature work.\nFamiliarity with localization and internationalization, including adapting products for RTL, Arabic text shaping, and regional educational workflows.\nExperience with SAML/OIDC, SIS/LMS integrations, or data interoperability standards (OneRoster, CSV/XLSX/XML export formats).\nComfort debugging tricky language formatting issues, including encoding, RTL rendering, and Unicode/bi-directional text handling.\nA strong product sense and empathy for users, especially teachers and students in bilingual or Arabic-medium classrooms.\nExperience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or similar) — especially S3, Lambda, queueing systems, or event-driven architectures.\n\n\nOur company participates in E-Verify.",
